	abstract = {Purpose
              This research clarifies the connotations and dimensions of artificial intelligence (AI) technology stimulation and establishes a stimulus scale to explain the relationship between AI technology stimuli and smart customer experience.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This is an empirical study that uses SPSS 24.0 software to perform hypothesis testing on the path relationships between model elements.
            
            
              Findings
              Two dimensions of AI technology stimuli (i.e. passion and usability) have a significant, positive impact on smart customer experience; the moderating effects of contrasting dimensions of technology readiness (i.e. optimism and discomfort) are significantly different; smart customer experience has a significant, positive impact on the word-of-mouth (WOM) intentions of consumers.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              There are several limitations. Most importantly, the data collected in this study are only from consumers who use intelligent customer service robots in the catering industry. Future research can consider exploring relevant AI technologies in other sectors.
            
            
              Practical implications
              This study has several implications that guide catering companies to develop various positioning and strategies for remaining competitive effectively.
            
            
              Originality/value
              Based on arousal theory, customer experience theory and WOM marketing theory, this is the first novel research project that empirically discusses the dimensions of AI technology stimuli, smart customer experience and WOM intentions with regard to the moderating effect of the technology readiness of consumers toward AI technology.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            In this study, we investigate the relationship between consumption and subjective well-being (SWB). There is clear evidence in the literature that the income–SWB relationship depends on the SWB measure, but the reasons are not fully clear yet; however, the main reason may be related to consumption because most income is used for that. This study is the first to examine directly whether the consumption–SWB relationship differs between affective, cognitive, and eudaimonic SWB measures. We adopt the following four SWB indices: life satisfaction, the Cantril ladder, affect balance, and eudaimonia. In addition, on the consumption side, we consider both material and relational consumption. Nonparametric analysis of our uniquely collected survey results in Japan suggests that total consumption contributes to cognitive measures of SWB and eudaimonia, while there is a certain threshold for affective measures. However, once material versus relational consumption is considered in total consumption, we find that relational consumption contributes to any SWB measure without clear upper bounds, while material consumption contributes to all SWB measures only to certain thresholds. Our results also show that the marginal effects of total consumption, material consumption, and relational consumption on cognitive measures of SWB and eudaimonia are greater than on affective measures. In addition, our results show that the marginal effects of relational consumption tend to be greater than those of material consumption for all SWB indices. Based on the findings, we expect relational consumption to be key for improving well-being.},

	abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) is a fast-developing technology with a broad range of use. The tourism industry, more specifically destinations, may benefit from its potential in the near future. By using VR in its marketing strategy, destinations have a substantial influence on the information search process and the decision-making process of potential tourists. Tourists can experience the destination, its atmosphere and possible emotions beforehand. Thus, they can create a more detailed destination image and realistic expectations of their visit. This transfers them into a better position to decide whether or not to visit a destination. This experimental study takes a closer look into a destination’s promotional material by analysing and comparing a self-designed brochure with an existing VR video of the city of Dubrovnik, Croatia. A total of 101 experiments were conducted at Fachhochschule Salzburg and UniparkNonntal. The research shows that VR transforms the information search experience into a faster, more interactive, and more detailed process compared to traditional promotional material. The results can be beneficial for destinations to understand how relevant using VR for tourism promotion is.The Gaze: Journal of Tourism and Hospitality Vol.9 2018 p.53-68},

Digital advertising is believed to be an effective way to better target potential customers in the global market. Evidence shows that businesses have increasingly switched their advertising focus from traditional to digital media. This research uses an empirical study that explores the effectiveness of digital advertising vs. traditional media advertising along several mass marketing dimensions. The results reveal that while traditional media advertising still holds its ground, digital advertising offers more effectiveness for promoting companies’ products. The results suggest that marketers need to use more digital advertising in order to better target their customers, particularly the young consumers.},

The brain circuits processing these signals are widespread and include the prefrontal cortex, amygdala and striatum, and their dopaminergic innervation. In this review, we integrate historic findings on the behavioral and neural mechanisms of value-based decision making with recent, groundbreaking work in this area. On the basis of this integrated view, we discuss a neuroeconomic framework of value-based decision making, use this to explain the motivation to pursue rewards and how motivation relates to the costs and benefits associated with different courses of action. As such, we consider substance addiction and overeating as states of altered value-based decision making, in which the expectation of reward chronically outweighs the costs associated with substance use and food consumption, respectively. Together, this review aims to provide a concise and accessible overview of important literature on the neural mechanisms of behavioral adaptation to reward and aversion and how these mediate motivated behaviors.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Emotion is typically understood to be an internal subjective experience originating in the brain. Yet in the somatosensory system hedonic information is coded by mechanoreceptors at the point of sensory contact before it reaches the central nervous system. It remains unknown, however, how these distinct peripheral channels for tactile hedonic information contribute to representations of interoceptive states relative to exteroceptive experience. In this fMRI study we applied representational similarity analyses with pattern component modeling, a technique that deconstructs representational states into a weighted set of distinct predefined constructs, to dissociate how discriminatory vs. hedonic tactile information, carried by A- and C-/CT-fibers respectively, contributes to population code representations in the human brain. Results demonstrated that information about appetitive and aversive tactile sensation is represented separately from non-hedonic tactile information across cortical structures. Specifically, although hedonic touch originates as a peripheral signal, labeled at the point of contact, representations in somatosensory cortices are guided by experiences of non-hedonic touch, By contrast, representations in regions associated with interoception and affect encode signals of hedonic touch. This provides evidence of complex tactile encoding that involves both external-exteroceptive and internal-interoceptive dimensions. Importantly, hedonic touch contributes to representations of internal state as well as those of externally generated stimulation.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) helps companies offer important benefits to consumers, such as health monitoring with wearable devices, advice with recommender systems, peace of mind with smart household products, and convenience with voice-activated virtual assistants. However, although AI can be seen as a neutral tool to be evaluated on efficiency and accuracy, this approach does not consider the social and individual challenges that can occur when AI is deployed. This research aims to bridge these two perspectives: on one side, the authors acknowledge the value that embedding AI technology into products and services can provide to consumers. On the other side, the authors build on and integrate sociological and psychological scholarship to examine some of the costs consumers experience in their interactions with AI. In doing so, the authors identify four types of consumer experiences with AI: (1) data capture, (2) classification, (3) delegation, and (4) social. This approach allows the authors to discuss policy and managerial avenues to address the ways in which consumers may fail to experience value in organizations’ investments into AI and to lay out an agenda for future research.},

	abstract = {This article reports the development and validation of a parsimonious, generalizable scale that measures the hedonic and utilitarian dimensions of consumer attitudes toward product categories and different brands within categories. The hedonic/utilitarian (HED/UT) scale includes ten semantic differential response items, five of which refer to the hedonic dimension and five of which refer to the utilitarian dimension of consumer attitudes. The authors conducted six studies to establish the unidimensionality, reliability, and validity of the two HED/UT subscales. In reaching the final scale, the authors also develop and implement a unique process of paring down a psychometrically sound but otherwise too large set of items. Nomological validity is established by replacing a typical, one-dimensional attitude toward the brand measure with the hedonic and utilitarian dimensions in a central route processing model. Results suggest that the hedonic and utilitarian constructs are two distinct dimensions of brand attitude and are reliably and validly measured by the HED/UT scale.},
