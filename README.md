Exogenous cognition and cognitive state theory

Very little research has explored the context of purchase decisions in terms of the effect of analytics driven decision support systems (i.e. the profiling and nudging of individuals via recommendations, saved options and preferences, biased searches and individualised webpages etc.). Following the Exogenous Cognitive Theory established by Smith et al. (2021) N/LAB is planning to explore the differential cognition and decision support for purchase decisions. The aim of the work is to study the information processing stage, i.e. information search stage prior and up to a choice. In phase 1, we plan to map the enjoyment of information search against the intention to use an App that can help with information search for several purchase scenarios using a survey. In the following phases, we plan to understand the differential outcomes of information search for online vs. offline purchases using lab-experiments inspired bey various psychometric and/or neuroscience oriented methods (phase 2) and explore the scenario pf online and offline purchase in the grocery sector via a live field experiment providing various measures for online search activity and outcome compared to metrics recorded via wearable technology (phase 3).
